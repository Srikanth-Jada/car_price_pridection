Car Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a dataset named "Car Price Prediction." The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate the price of a car based on its features.

Project Steps:
Data Preparation:

Data Cleaning: We fixed any issues with missing or incorrect data.
Data Visualization: We created charts and graphs to understand the data better and see how different features affect car prices.
Feature Analysis: We looked at important features like:
ID Proof
Airbags
Price
Levy
Manufacture
Model
Production Year
Leather Interior
Category
Engine Volume
Fuel Type
Doors
Color
Wheels
We also checked the shape of the data, identified any missing values, and explored unique values in the dataset.
Model Building:

Conclusion:
The project aims to create a reliable model that can help predict car prices based on key features, making it easier to understand what affects car values.
